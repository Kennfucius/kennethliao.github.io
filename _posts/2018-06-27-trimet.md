## Objective
In this study I examine vehicle delay data for the TriMet rail system to answer 3 important questions:

  1. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***most*** delays?
  2. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***longest*** total delay?
  3. Which rail ***stops*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

## Background

![TriMet Rail System Map]({{ "/images/rail-sys-map.png" | absolute_url }})

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TriMet's MAX Light Rail system in Portland, OR consists of 5 lines that run east-west or north-south, as shown in the map above. TriMet collects data from all of its rail vehicles throughout the day, 365 days a year. This data contains information about the vehicle's location, schedule info, and [more](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/vehicle_locations_ws.shtml). Most importantly, a vehicle's net delay along its route is reported at every stop. Here I explore 6 months of data spanning *January 2017* to *June 2017*. For more information on the original data source, please see [TriMet's developer resource page](https://developer.trimet.org/).

## Findings

> NOTE:  All visualizations are interactive and the data can be accessed through the "edit chart" button on each plot; visualizations were generated using [plotly](https://plot.ly/#/).

### 1. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***most*** delays?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 1 shows the number of times vehicles reported a delay, by rail line. The blue line had more than triple the number of delays as the red, orange, and yellow lines, and well over double the green line. A primary factor of delay count could be the distance covered by a line. This is certainly consistent with the blue line which services from Hillsboro to Gresham, however less obvious with the other lines. Another, possibly correlated factor, is the number of stops each line services. Does the blue line, which covers the greatest distance, also have the most stops?

#### Figure 1 | Total Number of Delays by Rail Line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table below shows the number of stops as well as the number of events or reported delays for each line. While the # of stops doesn't exactly correlate with total delay count, e.g. the red line has the 2nd most stops but the 3rd highest delay count, there is a strong trend. The orange and yellow lines have the least number of stops and also the least number of delays. The red and green lines are in-between in both delay count and number of stops, while the blue line has the most stops and also shows the highest delay count.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of events in the third column can be interpreted as the activity on that line. More events implies the line had more service. The event count also appears proportional to the delay count.

#### Table 1 | Number of Stops and Events Per Rail Line

| Rail Line | Stops (Count) | Events (Count) |
| ---- | :----: | :----: |
| Blue    | 113 | 2442917 |
| Green   | 48  | 886290  |
| Red     | 65  | 869139  |
| Orange  | 26  | 592042  |
| Yellow  | 35  | 585471  |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, we have only looked at the raw number of delays reported by a line. We can divide this number by the total number of reports (on-time, ahead of schedule, or delayed) to get a proportion. Figure 2 shows the percentage of time a rail line reported a delay. Interestingly, the blue line has the 2nd lowest percentage. The orange and yellow lines had the lowest total delay counts but are delayed most of the time. Compare the blue line which is delayed 70.2% of the time to the orange line which is delayed 77.6% of the time!

### 2. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to having the most delays, Figure 3 shows that the blue line also has the longest total delay. ***In a 6 month period, the blue line was delayed by ~2646 hours or about 110 days!*** The yellow line has the 2nd longest total delay. Recall that the yellow line, which services between the expo center and PSU, is also the 2nd most often delayed (Figure 2). The average delay is also shown in seconds for each line. In this case, red is ranked first with an average delay of 272 seconds. Looking at the range in average delay between the orange and red lines, we can see the average between lines differs by about 1 minute and 25 seconds.

### 3. Which rail ***stops*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top 5 stops with the longest total delay are shown in Figure 3. The bars show the total delay each rail line had for that stop, and the scatter-line shows the total delay (sum of the bars per stop) on the right axis. First, note that these top 5 stops are all serviced by the blue, green, and red lines: they are not serviced by the orange and yellow lines. Recall that these 3 lines have the highest delay counts (Figure 1) *and* the most activity (Table 1). The order between lines seen in Figure 1 is preserved for each stop here: blue always has the highest delay, followed by green and then red.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I mapped just these 5 stops in Figure 4. The first thing I noticed is that all 5 stops are on the east side, servicing between Loyd District and Woodland Park. One thing to point out about these 5 stops is that they're along the only route that connects the far east side of Portland and beyond, to the west side: this includes PDX airport, Gresham, and Clackamas.

> NOTE: I applied a small amount of jitter to data points in Figures 4 and 6. Zooming in around a particular stop resolves the 3 lines.

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 5 shows a scatter-heatmap showing the mean delay for all rail stops. The 5 stops we analyzed are highlighted by a larger magenta circle. First, notice that the top 5 stops have mean delays ranging from 80s to 150s. We can see from the scale on the right that some stops have up to ~250s average delays. So in terms of mean delay, these 5 stops look quite average. This indicates that other stops can have much higher average delays, but likely have less service. While the top 5 stops have average delays with a high volume of service stops, leading to the highest total delay in the 6-month span I analyzed.
