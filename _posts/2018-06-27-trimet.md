## Objective
In this study I examine vehicle delay data for the TriMet rail system in Portland, OR, to answer 3 important questions:

  1. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***most*** delays?
  2. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***longest*** total delay?
  3. Which rail ***stops*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

## Background

![TriMet Rail System Map]({{ "/images/rail-sys-map.png" | absolute_url }})

The TriMet rail system consists of 5 lines that run east-west or north-south as shown in the map above. TriMet collects data from all of its rail vehicles throughout the day, 365 days a year. This data contains information about the vehicle's location, schedule info, and [more](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/vehicle_locations_ws.shtml). Most importantly, a vehicle's net delay along its route is reported at every stop. Here I explore 6 months of data spanning *January 2017* to *June 2017*. For more information on the original data source, please see [TriMet's developer resource page](https://developer.trimet.org/).

> NOTE:  All visualizations are interactive and the data can be accessed through the "edit chart" button on each plot; visualizations generated using [plotly](https://plot.ly/#/).

## Findings

### 1. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***most*** delays?

Figure 1 shows the number of times vehicles reported a delay, by rail line. The blue line had more than triple the number of delays as the red, orange, and yellow lines, and well over double the green line. A primary factor of delay count could be the distance covered by a line. The cartoon system map above shows the blue line covers the longest distance. Another, possibly correlated factor, would be the number of stops each line has. I would expect the blue line to have the most stops if it covers the longest distance.

The table below shows the number of stops each rail line services. While the # of stops doesn't exactly correlate with total delay count, e.g. the red line has the 2nd most stops but the 3rd highest delay count, there is a strong trend. The orange and yellow lines have the least number of stops and also the least number of delays. The red and green lines are in the middle in both delay count and number of stops, and finally the blue line has the most stops and also shows the highest delay count.

#### Table 1 | Number of Stops Per Rail Line
  | Rail Line | # of Stops |
  | --- | :---: |
  | Blue    | 113 |
  | Green   | 48  |
  | Red     | 65  |
  | Orange  | 26  |
  | Yellow  | 35  |

The blue line clearly has the highest delay count, but does it also have the highest proportion of delays? So far, we have only looked at the raw number of delays reported by a line, but we can divide this number by the total number of reports (on-time, ahead of schedule, or delayed). Figure 2 shows the percentage of time a rail line reported a delay. Interestingly, the blue line has the 2nd lowest percentage. The orange and yellow lines had the lowest total delay counts but are delayed most of the time.

### 2. Which rail ***lines*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

In addition to having the most delays, Figure 3 shows that the blue rail line also had the longest total delay. ***In a 6 month period, the blue line was delayed by ~2646 hours or about 110 days!*** The yellow line has the 2nd longest total delay. Recall that the yellow line, which services between the expo center and PSU, is also the 2nd most often delayed line (Figure 2). Figure 3 also shows the average delay in seconds for each rail line (scatter-line). In this case, red is the clear winner with an average delay of 272 seconds.

### 3. Which rail ***stops*** have the ***longest*** total delay?

The total delay per stop was calculated by summing delays reported by each rail line for each stop. The top 5 stops with the longest total delay are shown in Figure 3. The bars show the total delay each rail line had for that stop, and the scatter-line shows the total delay (sum of the bars) on the right axis. First, note that these top 5 stops are all serviced by the blue, green, and red lines: they are not serviced by the orange and yellow lines. Also evident is that for each stop, blue has the longest total delay followed by green and then red. This pareto chart suggests the top 5 stops to investigate regarding delays.
